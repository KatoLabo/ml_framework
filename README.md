## Requirements
Current setup has no GPU. Installation of Keras and Tensorflow are here:
[Keras Installation](https://keras.io/#installation),
[Tensorflow Installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
Let me know if I missed any requirements. I'm using Python 2.7.
## Classifying Messy/Clean Room
<a name="onetoten"> </a>
### Initial Goal (Pre Work)
Since it's not yet clear whether I can do object detection, I've decided
to begin with a simple classifying project. Since the objective is to
receive some sort of figure that tells you how messy (or preferably, how
  many objects of a certain kind are present, like t-shirts, cup ramen, etc)
the room is, we can start with a simple 1 to 10 classification problem.

### Approach
The approach is based off of the [hackster.io article on how to classify a room messy or not.](https://www.hackster.io/matt-farley/use-artificial-intelligence-to-detect-messy-clean-rooms-f224a2).
